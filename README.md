# euler

C++ solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problems) problems.

## Execution

All solutions have been tested on Ubuntu 15.04 (64-bit), with g++ 4.9.2.

``` bash
g++ "001 - Multiples of 3 and 5.cpp" && ./a.out
```

## Notes

* **10 - Summation of primes** takes a VERY long time to complete, as it uses a very primitive method of working out primes.
